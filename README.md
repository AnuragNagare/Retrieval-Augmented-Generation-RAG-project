AI-Powered Skin Disease Detection with Streamlit, TensorFlow, and PubMed Integration! ü©∫
I‚Äôm thrilled to share my latest innovation‚Äîa web-based application designed to detect and analyze skin diseases using deep learning models! This solution leverages the power of TensorFlow, Streamlit, and PubMed, making it a truly next-gen tool in the field of healthcare.

üí° How It Works:

Image Classification with CNN: The heart of the app is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to recognize seven different types of skin conditions: Melanocytic nevi, Melanoma, Benign keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic keratoses, Vascular lesions, and Dermatofibroma. With this model, the app can predict the type of skin disease with high accuracy from a simple image.

Information at Your Fingertips: For each detected condition, the app provides detailed insights, including:

Precautions you should take to manage or prevent the condition.
Medications commonly recommended for treatment.
Dietary advice to promote skin health and recovery.

Integration with PubMed: The app is integrated with PubMed, a vast database of medical literature, to fetch the latest research articles related to the predicted disease. Users can quickly access reliable sources and dive deeper into understanding their condition.

Technologies Used:
TensorFlow: Powers the CNN model for accurate disease prediction.

Streamlit: Creates an intuitive and interactive web interface for a seamless user experience.

PubMed API: Enables the retrieval of medical research articles to keep the user informed with credible scientific data.

üåç Why This is a New-Age Solution:

AI-Driven Diagnosis: With AI at its core, this tool democratizes access to healthcare information and empowers individuals to make informed decisions.

Real-Time Insights: The combination of machine learning predictions with real-time data from PubMed brings a level of transparency and knowledge that‚Äôs never been more accessible.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, the app is not only powerful but also incredibly easy to use, making it suitable for both healthcare professionals and everyday users.
